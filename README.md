## Tech Stack

**Built with**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) with [Express layer](https://expressjs.com/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) & [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
- [Redux Form](https://redux-form.com)

## Features

This is a toy app that allows you to make fake payments with Stripe and send out simple email surveys with SendGrid.

The app was coded with the help of [Stephen Grinder's](https://github.com/StephenGrider) Udemy course [Node with React: FullStack Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development).

Differences/enhancements over the course:

- uses [Passport-Next fork](https://github.com/passport-next/passport) and [Passport-Next Google OAuth 2.0 Strategy](https://github.com/passport-next/passport-google-oauth2) instead of the stale upstream repositories (and deprecated G+ auth)
- additional error handling with try/catch for Redux actions
- conditional rendering on the homepage depending on authentication
- protected routes if user is not authenticated
- 404 page and client-side "catch-all" routing
- uses Ramda.js instead of Lodash.js
